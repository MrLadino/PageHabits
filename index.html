                <h2>
                    Getting enough sleep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting enough sleep refers to the practice of ensuring that one gets a sufficient amount of restorative sleep each night. Adequate sleep is essential for overall health and well-being, as it allows the body to rest and repair itself, supports brain function, and helps regulate mood and emotions. The recommended amount of sleep varies by age, with adults generally needing between 7-9 hours per night. Poor sleep habits can lead to a variety of health issues, including an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and mental health disorders. Therefore, prioritizing sleep and establishing a regular sleep routine are important for maintaining optimal health.
